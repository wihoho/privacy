# OmniSearch Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: July 8, 2025**

## Overview

OmniSearch is a Chrome extension that provides quick search shortcuts for popular websites directly from your browser's address bar. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.** OmniSearch operates entirely within your browser and does not transmit any information to external servers.

### What We Don't Collect

- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browsing history or website visits
- Search queries or search terms
- User behavior or analytics data
- Device information or identifiers
- Location data
- Any form of tracking data

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

OmniSearch stores the following data locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage API:

- **Search shortcuts configuration**: Your enabled/disabled shortcuts and custom shortcuts you create
- **User preferences**: Settings like first-time user status
- **Custom search URLs**: Any custom search shortcuts you add

### Chrome Sync Storage

If you have Chrome sync enabled in your browser, your OmniSearch settings may sync across your Chrome browsers on different devices. This is handled entirely by Google Chrome's sync infrastructure and is subject to Google's privacy policy.

**Important**: We do not have access to your Chrome sync data. The syncing is handled automatically by Chrome itself.

## Data Usage

The data stored by OmniSearch is used solely to:

- Remember your search shortcut preferences
- Provide custom search functionality you configure
- Maintain your settings across browser sessions

## Third-Party Services

### Search Redirections

When you use OmniSearch to search a website (e.g., YouTube, Amazon), you are redirected to that website's search page. This redirection is subject to the privacy policy of the destination website.

**We do not track or monitor these redirections.** OmniSearch simply constructs the search URL and tells your browser to navigate to it.

### Website Favicons

OmniSearch may load website favicons (small icons) from external websites to display in the settings interface. These requests are made directly by your browser and are not tracked by us.

## Permissions Explanation

OmniSearch requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **`storage`**: To save your shortcuts and preferences locally
- **`activeTab`**: To open search results in your current tab when requested

We request only the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to function.

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No data transmission to external servers
- No user accounts or authentication required
- No cookies or tracking mechanisms used

## Children's Privacy

OmniSearch does not collect any data from users of any age. The extension is safe for use by children as it operates entirely locally and does not collect personal information.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of OmniSearch after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Deletion

To delete all OmniSearch data:

1. **Remove the extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find OmniSearch, and click "Remove"
2. **Clear storage manually**: Use the debug console or Chrome's developer tools to clear extension storage

All OmniSearch data will be permanently deleted when you remove the extension.

- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) principles

## Summary

**In simple terms**: OmniSearch is a privacy-focused extension that works entirely in your browser. We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. Your search shortcuts and preferences stay on your device.
